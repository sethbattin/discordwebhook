1. A discord server with channel that has a webhook.  Check out [that, help is available in this github repository's wiki.
2. A text editor.  This example uses a single html file to send data to discord, and it is easy to edit with any program that allows typing.  The content may be incorporated into a much more complicated website, but that is beyond the scope of this example.
