discordwebhook
==============
An example of using a Discord webhook with a basic HTML form.

Type your message in your html file:  
![HTML form](img/htmlform.png)

See your message in discord:  
![Discord message](img/discord.png)

Who
---
This example is meant for anyone who wants to practice basic HTML.  It uses an HTML form to send a message in a discord channel, so it's also useful for anyone who wants that to happen in their discord server.

What
----
Following this example requires only two things:
1. A discord server with channel that has a webhook.  It may require help from a server admin; see [this guide about creating a webhook](https://github.com/Akizo96/de.isekaidev.discord.wbbBridge/wiki/How-to-get-Webhook-ID-&-Token).
2. A text editor.  This example uses a single html file to send data to discord, and it is easy to edit with any program that allows typing.
