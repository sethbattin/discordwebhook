discordwebhook
==============
An example of using a Discord webhook with a basic HTML form.

Type your message in your html file:  
![HTML form](img/htmlform.png)

See your message in discord:  
![Discord message](img/discord.png)

Who
---
This example is meant for anyone who wants to practice basic HTML.  It uses an HTML form to send a message in a discord channel, so it's also useful for anyone who wants that to happen in their discord server.

What
----
Following this example requires only two things:
1. A discord server with channel that has a webhook.  It may require help from a server admin; see [this guide about creating a webhook](https://github.com/Akizo96/de.isekaidev.discord.wbbBridge/wiki/How-to-get-Webhook-ID-&-Token).
2. A text editor.  This example uses a single html file to send data to discord, and it is easy to edit with any program that allows typing.

How
---

### Step 1: First post
To follow this example step by step, start by downloading [the step 1 html file](step1.html).  It will show us an almost-working HTML form that submits a message to discord.

### Step 2: New form who dis?
After the form is working, we can change it further.  Download [the step 2 html file](step2.html).  With this, we'll change the name attached to the message that appears in discord.

### Step 3: 1000 words
Now that we can control what we say and who says it, let's also upload a file!  (Coming Soon)
