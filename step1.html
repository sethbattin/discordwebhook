		<h1>Discord Webhook Example</h1>
		<p>This html form allows you to post to discord.  
		Type a message and press <em>Enter</em> or push the <em>post</em> button.</p>
		<!-- 
	  		This form doesn't work yet!  If we send the form, it will just reload the page.

			In order to make the form work, we have to tell it to send its information to
			discord.  To do that, we fill in the "action" attribute below with the webhook.

			Get the webhook address (very long with lots of numbers and letters) from your
			discord admin.
			To learn more about how HTML forms work, read this documentation:
			https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form

			After you add the action, hitting "post" should send the message to discord
		-->
		<form 
			action=""
			method="POST"
		>
			<label for="username-input">Username</label>
			<select id="username-input" type="select" name="username" disabled >
				<option value="Webhook Example">Webhook Example</option>
			</select>
			<label for="content-input">Message</label>
			<input id="content-input" type="text" name="content" required />
			<input type="submit" name="send" value="post" />
